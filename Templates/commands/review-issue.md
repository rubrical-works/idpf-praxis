<!-- EXTENSIBLE -->
# /review-issue
Reviews GitHub issues with type-specific criteria. Delegates setup to `review-preamble.js`, cleanup to `review-finalize.js`.
**Extension Points:** `.claude/metadata/extension-points.json` or `/extensions list --command review-issue`

## Prerequisites
`gh pmu` installed; `.gh-pmu.json` configured.

## Arguments
| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `#issue` | Yes | Issue numbers (`#42` or `42 43 44`) |
| `--with` | No | Domain extensions (`security,performance` or `all`) |
| `--mode` | No | Review mode override: `solo`/`team`/`enterprise` |
| `--force` | No | Force re-review even if `reviewed` label present |

Multi: `/review-issue #42 #43 #44` reviews each sequentially.

## Execution Instructions
**REQUIRED:** Routed command — two-phase task creation:
1. **Phase 1:** Single `TaskCreate` for preamble step only.
2. **Phase 2:** After preamble confirms path (no redirect, no early exit), bulk-create tasks for all remaining steps + one per non-empty `USER-EXTENSION` block.
3. **On redirect/early exit:** Mark preamble completed; do NOT create remaining tasks.
4. **Track Progress:** mark each task `in_progress` → `completed` as you work it.
5. **Post-Compaction:** Re-read spec; resume from first incomplete task — no re-routing.

## Workflow
Multi-issue: process each sequentially through Steps 1–3.

### Step 1: Setup (Preamble Script)
```bash
node ./.claude/scripts/shared/review-preamble.js $ISSUE [--with extensions] [--mode mode] [--force]
```
Parse JSON. Branches:
- `ok: false` → report `errors[0].message` → **STOP** (skip to next in batch)
- `context.redirect` set → invoke skill **dynamically** using `context.redirect` (strip leading `/`) — all three rows below are equally normative (#2428):

  | `context.redirect` | Skill invocation |
  |---|---|
  | `/review-proposal` (label `proposal`) | `Skill("review-proposal", args: "#$ISSUE [--with ...] [--mode ...] [--force]")` |
  | `/review-prd` (label `prd`) | `Skill("review-prd", args: "#$ISSUE [--with ...] [--mode ...] [--force]")` |
  | `/review-test-plan` (label `test-plan`) | `Skill("review-test-plan", args: "#$ISSUE [--with ...] [--mode ...] [--force]")` |

  Pass `--with`/`--mode`/`--force`. → **STOP**. Do not dispatch only for the proposal case.
- `context.issue.state === "closed"` → ask user to confirm before proceeding
- `earlyExit: true` (has `reviewed` label, no `--force`) → report review count → **STOP**

Extract: `context` (type, reviewNumber, title, labels, body), `criteria` (common from `.claude/metadata/review-mode-criteria.json`, typeSpecific from `.claude/metadata/review-criteria.json`), `extensions`, `warnings`.

Extension loading handled by preamble via `.claude/metadata/review-extensions.json`. Unknown IDs warn; missing/malformed → standard review only.

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: pre-review -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: pre-review -->

### Step 2: Evaluate Criteria

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: criteria-customize -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: criteria-customize -->

**2a: Auto-Evaluate Objective Criteria** — for each objective criterion in `criteria.common` and `criteria.typeSpecific`, evaluate by reading issue content. Re-read `.claude/metadata/review-criteria.json` from disk (not memory) if stale. Emit ✅/⚠️/❌ with evidence using `autoCheck` field for guidance.

**2a-ii: Proposed Solution Repair + Files-to-Modify Derivation** (Bug, Enhancement, Story; NOT epic)
**(a) Repair — conditional.** Trigger: `proposed-solution` or `proposed-fix-described` is ❌/⚠️. Placeholder = under 20 chars or matches "TBD"/"To be documented"/"..."/empty. When triggered: analyze codebase, generate **Approach**, **Files to modify**, **Implementation steps**, **Testing considerations**. Present as `#### Proposed Solution (Auto-Generated)` (enhancement/story) or `#### Proposed Fix (Auto-Generated)` (bug). Otherwise content already substantive (>20 chars, no placeholder).
**(b) Derive and persist `Files to modify:` — always (#2520).** Runs for every bug/enhancement/story **regardless of whether (a) fired**. The old trigger tied the list to *repairing* a bad Proposed Solution, so a well-authored issue never got one — careful authoring guaranteed a later Step 4c halt.
- **Deficient — (a) fired:** reuse the **Files to modify** list (a) produced. Do not derive it twice.
- **Substantive — (a) skipped:** **Extract** the list from the existing Proposed Solution + codebase analysis. Do **not** regenerate a Proposed Solution; (a)'s generation path is deficient-case only.
Write into the **issue body** — review output alone leaves `scope-drift-check.js` unable to see it. **Format contract** (`extractFilesToModify`, no parser change): header exactly `**Files to modify:**` or `**Files:**` on its own line, then one backticked path per `- ` bullet; terminates at the first blank line, any `**bold:**` line, or any `##` heading. No blank line inside the list, and **not a table** — markdown puts a blank line before a table, terminating the section and yielding empty declared scope.
**Refresh, don't append.** On re-review replace the existing section in place. Reviewing an unchanged issue twice must produce no body diff.
**Ordering is load-bearing** — same rule as 2a-iv, same reason. Write **here, before Step 3 finalize runs**. `review-finalize.js` does its own read-modify-write to increment `**Reviews:** N`; a write concurrent with or after it races that update, later write wins, loser vanishes with no error. Never write during or after Step 3, and do not "simplify" by folding this write into `review-finalize.js`. **Payoff:** a declared path is exempt from the always-protected halt (`checkDrift`'s `isProtected && !inDeclared` guard), so an issue declaring what it touches clears Step 4c without a `Scope-Override`; since #2520 a declaration no longer forces blocking mode, files added during implementation warn as growth.

**2a-iii: Epic-Specific Evaluation** — for epic type: `sub-issue-review` requires recursive review of sub-issues through 2a–2b including 2a-ii with per-sub-issue body updates. `construction-context` scans `Construction/Design-Decisions/` and `Construction/Tech-Debt/` for files referencing sub-issue numbers. None found → report gracefully.

**2a-iv: Prior-Art Sweep When Marker Absent (#2517)**
Trigger: `prior-art-checked` criterion evaluates ❌ (marker absent, or `PARTIAL` — an incomplete sweep, treated as absent and re-swept).
Delegate the decision; do not re-derive it:
```bash
node -e "console.log(JSON.stringify(require('./.claude/scripts/shared/lib/prior-art-marker.js').decideSweep({body:BODY,createdAt:CREATED_AT,reviewSweep:REVIEW_SWEEP})))"
```
**Arguments — substitute from the named source; never leave a literal placeholder.** `BODY` ← `context.issue.body`; `CREATED_AT` ← **`context.issue.createdAt`** (ISO 8601, added #2539); `REVIEW_SWEEP` ← `framework-config.json` `reviewSweep` (absent = on).
**`createdAt` decides whether the criterion means anything.** `isExemptFromSweep` treats an absent/unparseable value as exempt — the safe direction, but it makes `decideSweep` return `not-applicable` for *every* unmarked issue. Before #2539 the preamble emitted no such field, so that is exactly what happened. Never substitute a hand-entered date.
**A `CREATED_AT_UNAVAILABLE` preamble warning** → say so in the criterion rather than reporting a bare `not-applicable`: the timestamp could not be established, so the sweep was not skipped on the merits.
Returns `{sweep, status, reason}`. Report the criterion with that `status`; act on `sweep`.
| status | Action |
|---|---|
| `pass` | Complete marker present — no sweep, no write |
| `fail` | Marker absent or `PARTIAL` — run the sweep |
| `skip` ⊘ | `reviewSweep` false in `framework-config.json` — no sweep, no write. Report ⊘, **not** ❌, which would downgrade every review in a project that opted out |
| `not-applicable` | Predates the feature (pinned cutoff) — no sweep; absence is meaningless for what could not be swept |
**Sweeping:** run the #2514 procedure, reading `.claude/metadata/prior-art-sweep.json` for surfaces, excludes, term derivation, dispositions and body formats — none restated here.
**Output:** findings in the review; write `**Prior Art:**` into the body via `insertPriorArtSection` from the same helper.
**Ordering is load-bearing.** Write **here, before Step 3 finalize**, so `review-finalize.js`'s read-modify-write for `**Reviews:** N` reads a body already containing the section. A write concurrent with or after finalize races it — both read-modify-write the same body, later wins, loser vanishes with no error. Never write during or after Step 3.
**Recommendation:** prior art duplicating the issue's scope is blocking — `Needs revision` or stronger, not a passing note.
**Missing config:** `prior-art-sweep.json` missing/unreadable → report criterion, warn, skip sweep. Do not fail the review.

**2b: Ask Subjective Criteria** — for subjective criteria applicable to current reviewMode, use `AskUserQuestion`. Re-read `.claude/metadata/review-mode-criteria.json` from disk for question/options. Solo mode: skip entirely.

**2c: Extension Criteria** (if `--with`) — evaluate domain criteria loaded by preamble.

**2c-ii: Security Finding Label** — if `--with security`/`--with all` and any security finding ⚠️/❌:
```bash
gh issue edit $ISSUE --add-label=security-finding
```
All ✅ → no label.

**2d: Recommendation** — one of: `Ready for work` (no blocking concerns) / `Needs minor revision` (small) / `Needs revision` (must address before starting) / `Needs major rework` (fundamental).

### Step 3: Finalize (Script)
Write findings JSON to `.tmp-$ISSUE-findings.json`. **Read** `.claude/scripts/shared/lib/findings-schema.json` for contract structure, required fields, status values, recommendation values. Solo mode: `userEvaluated` always `[]`.

```bash
node ./.claude/scripts/shared/review-finalize.js $ISSUE -F .tmp-$ISSUE-findings.json
```
Finalize handles: body metadata (`**Reviews:** N` increment), structured comment posting, label assignment (`reviewed`/`pending`), epic sub-issue label propagation. Clean up temp file. Report summary from output.

For non-`--with` runs, append: `Tip: Use --with security,performance to add domain-specific review criteria. Available: security, accessibility, performance, chaos, contract, qa, seo, privacy (or --with all)`
**Extensions Applied** in review comment lists only domains producing findings (omit empty). At least one domain section must appear when `--with` used; if none produce findings, fall back to standard review with warning.

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-review -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-review -->

### Step 3a: Interdependence Analysis (Multi-Issue Only)
Trigger: 2+ issues reviewed AND all eligible per `typeFilter` in `.claude/metadata/review-interdependence.json`. Eligible: `bug`, `enhancement`, `prd`, `test-plan`. Excluded: `proposal`, `epic` (excluded wins).

After all individual reviews complete:
```javascript
const { analyzeInterdependence, isEligibleForInterdependence } = require('.claude/scripts/shared/review-interdependence.js');
const allEligible = reviewedIssues.every(i => isEligibleForInterdependence(i.labels));
if (allEligible) {
  const result = analyzeInterdependence(reviewedIssues);
}
```
`reviewedIssues` = array of `{ number, title, type, labels, body }` collected during reviews.

Report: **Overlap** (shared scope), **Ordering** (suggested order + rationale), **Conflicts** (contradictory requirements), **Shared Criteria** (ACs in multiple issues).

If findings exist, offer:
```
Interdependence findings for #42, #43, #44:
[findings table]

Suggested order: #43 → #42 → #44

Update issues with cross-references? (y/n)
```
If accepted, add `Refs #N` notes to related issue bodies. No findings → `"No interdependence detected between reviewed issues."` and continue.

Configuration: dimensions and `typeFilter` in `.claude/metadata/review-interdependence.json` (config-driven; add to `eligible`/`excluded` to customize). Single-issue: skipped.

### Step 4: Closing Notification
Output `closingNotification` from finalize. Multi-issue: `"Reviews complete: #42, #43, #44"`.

## Error Handling
| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Preamble `ok: false` | Report `errors[0].message` → STOP |
| Issue not found | Preamble error → STOP |
| Issue closed | Ask user (from preamble context) |
| Unknown label | Preamble uses generic criteria |
| Finalize fails | Report error; body may already be updated |
