<!-- EXTENSIBLE -->
# /prepare-release

Validate, create PR to main, merge, and tag for deployment.

**Extension Points:** See `.claude/metadata/extension-points.json` or run `/extensions list --command prepare-release`
## Arguments
| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `[version]` | Version to release (e.g., v1.2.0) |
| `--skip-coverage` | Skip coverage gate |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without changes |
| `--help` | Show extension points |

## Execution Instructions

**REQUIRED:** Before executing:
1. **Create Task List:** Parse phases and extension points, use `TaskCreate`
2. **Include Extensions:** Add task for each non-empty `USER-EXTENSION` block
3. **Track Progress:** Mark tasks `in_progress` → `completed`
4. **Post-Compaction:** Re-read spec and regenerate tasks

**Task Rules:** One task per numbered phase/step; one per active extension; skip commented-out extensions.

## Pre-Checks
### Check for Uncommitted Changes

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**If empty (clean):** Proceed silently. **If non-empty (dirty):** Report changes, then present via `AskUserQuestion`:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Working tree has uncommitted changes. These could be lost when the branch is closed. How would you like to proceed?",
    header: "Dirty tree",
    options: [
      { label: "Stage and commit all", description: "Run git add -A and commit with a message you provide" },
      { label: "Let me review first", description: "Stop here so you can review and handle changes manually" },
      { label: "Continue anyway", description: "Proceed with release preparation despite uncommitted changes" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
});
```

- **"Stage and commit all":** Ask for commit message, then `git add -A && git commit -m "<message>"`. Report commit. Continue.
- **"Let me review first":** Report `"Stopping. Review uncommitted changes, then re-run /prepare-release."` → **STOP**
- **"Continue anyway":** Report `"⚠️ Warning: Proceeding with uncommitted changes."` Continue.

### Verify Current Branch

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Record as `$BRANCH`.

### Auto-Create Release Branch (if on main)

**If `$BRANCH` is `main`:**
1. Analyze commits: `git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline`
2. Recommend version based on commit analysis
3. **ASK USER:** Confirm version (e.g., `v0.26.0`)
4. **If `--dry-run`:** Report "Would create branch: release/v0.26.0" and stop.
5. Create release branch:
   ```bash
   gh pmu branch start --name "release/$VERSION"
   git checkout "release/$VERSION"
   git push -u origin "release/$VERSION"
   ```
6. Update `$BRANCH` to `release/$VERSION`
7. Report: "Created release branch: release/$VERSION. Continuing..."

**If NOT `main`:** Continue with existing working branch.

### Check for Incomplete Issues

```bash
gh pmu list --branch current --status backlog,in_progress,in_review
```

**Do not add `--json`** — `status` is not a valid JSON field for `gh pmu list`.

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: pre-phase-1 -->

## Phase 1: Analysis

### Step 1.1: Analyze Changes

```bash
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline
```

### Analyze Commits

```bash
node .claude/scripts/shared/analyze-commits.js
```

Outputs JSON: `lastTag`, `commits`, `summary` (counts by type). This is the **commit inventory** the changelog consumes — it **does not decide the version**.

### Recommend Version

```bash
node .claude/scripts/shared/recommend-version.js
```

**`recommend-version.js` is authoritative for the version bump (#2602).** When the two disagree its verdict governs, and `analyze-commits.js`'s `summary` counts are not evidence against it.

They classify differently by design: `analyze-commits.js` reads conventional-commit prefixes only; `recommend-version.js` reads prefixes, then falls back to `Refs #N` → issue-label lookup, then keyword heuristics.

**Under a `Refs #N` convention the disagreement is the steady state, not an edge case.** Every commit types as `other`, so `summary` reads `feat: 0, fix: 0` on **every** release — which looks like "no features this release" when it means "this classifier cannot see them". Measured here at `v0.100.2..HEAD`: 38 commits, all `other`, against a `minor` recommendation.

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-analysis -->

**ASK USER:** Confirm version before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Validation

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: pre-validation -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: pre-validation -->

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-validation -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-validation -->

**ASK USER:** Confirm validation passed.

## Phase 3: Prepare

### Step 3.1: Update Version Files

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add new section following Keep a Changelog format |
| `README.md` | Update version badge or header |
| `README-DIST.md` | **If present** — verify skill/specialist counts match actuals, license populated. Absent in most consuming projects |
| `framework-config.json` | (Self-hosted only) Update `frameworkVersion` and `installedDate` |
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: pre-commit -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: pre-commit -->

### Step 3.2: Commit Preparation

```bash
for path in CHANGELOG.md README.md README-DIST.md Docs/; do
  if [ -e "$path" ]; then git add "$path"; fi
done
git commit -m "chore: prepare release $VERSION"
git push
```

**Stage only what exists (#2602).** `git add` on a missing pathspec is **fatal** (exit 128) — nothing staged, no commit. `README-DIST.md` exists here and in almost no consuming project. Adjust the path list to this project's release files; the existence guard makes an extra entry harmless, not a reason to leave a wrong one.

**Casing is load-bearing.** The pathspec must match how git tracks the directory (`Docs/` here). A wrong-case pathspec is a second fatal `git add` on a case-sensitive filesystem, and passes silently on Windows and macOS — invisible where releases are usually prepared.

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-prepare -->

**CRITICAL:** Do not proceed until CI passes.

## Phase 4: Git Operations

### Step 4.1: Create PR to Main

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head $(git branch --show-current) \
  --title "Release $VERSION"
```

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-pr-create -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-pr-create -->

### Step 4.2: Merge PR

**ASK USER:** Approve and merge.

```bash
gh pr merge --merge
```

### Step 4.3: Close Branch Tracker

```bash
gh pmu branch close --yes
```

### Step 4.4: Switch to Main

```bash
before=$(git stash list | wc -l)
git stash push -m "prepare-release $VERSION"
after=$(git stash list | wc -l)

git checkout main
git pull origin main

if [ "$after" -gt "$before" ]; then git stash pop; fi
```

**Note:** the stash handles uncommitted `settings.local.json` changes (session-specific permission entries added by Claude Code).

**Pop only when something was stashed (#2602).** On a clean tree `git stash` saves nothing and exits 0, then `git stash pop` exits **1** with `No stash entries found.` — the last command before the tag step. The pair straddles checkout/pull, so the sequence appears to work and ends on a failure immediately before an irreversible tag.

The guard compares `git stash list` before and after rather than testing the tree: `git status --porcelain` can report changes `git stash push` declines to save, so a dirtiness test and the stash's own behaviour can disagree. The stash count cannot.

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: pre-tag -->
<!-- Final gate before tagging - add sign-off checks here -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: pre-tag -->

### Step 4.5: Remove Active Label

```bash
node .claude/scripts/shared/lib/active-label.js remove [TRACKER_NUMBER]
```

### Step 4.6: Tag and Push

**ASK USER:** Confirm ready to tag.

```bash
git tag -a $VERSION -m "Release $VERSION"
echo "$VERSION | gates passed | $(git rev-parse HEAD)" > .release-authorized
git push origin $VERSION; rc=$?
rm -f .release-authorized
exit $rc
```

**Note:** `.release-authorized` is the marker `.claude/hooks/pre-push` requires before allowing a `v*` tag push. The hook only tests existence and echoes contents verbatim, so this line becomes the release audit record. Cleanup is unconditional — the exit code is captured **before** `rm -f` and propagated after. A plain echo/push/rm sequence is not sufficient: a failed push aborts before the `rm`, and the surviving marker authorizes the next tag push with no gate having run.

### Step 4.7: Wait for CI on the Pushed Tag

**Conditional:** the wait is only meaningful if some workflow triggers on a tag.

```bash
grep -lE '^[[:space:]]*tags:' .github/workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/*.yaml 2>/dev/null
```

**If nothing matches:** skip with a message naming the reason: `No tag-triggered workflows detected — skipping post-tag CI wait.`

**If a tag-triggered workflow exists:**
```bash
node .claude/scripts/shared/wait-for-ci.js --branch $VERSION --timeout 900
```
**If the run fails or times out, STOP and report** its URL and conclusion. Do not continue to Step 4.8 — the tag is already pushed, so this is the last point at which a broken publish can be caught before the release is announced.

**Scope the wait to the TAG, not the checked-out branch (#2653).** This step used to resolve the branch name at runtime and pass that. After Step 4.4 the checked-out branch is `main`, and a tag-triggered run carries the **tag name** as its `headBranch` — so `matchesFilter` rejected the run the tag had just created, and the newest `main` run supplied the verdict: the already-completed post-merge `Tests` run. The gate reported a pass without waiting for anything, **vacuous in exactly the projects that have tag-triggered workflows**. `$VERSION` is the tag, so the existing filter matches with no change to `selectRun()`. (The defective form is described, not quoted: a guard test rejects that literal anywhere in this step.)

**`--branch` is still not optional (#2464).** Bare, the gate passes a null filter and `selectRun()` returns the newest run **repo-wide** — an unrelated run can supply the verdict. **`--timeout 900`** states the budget explicitly rather than relying on adaptive extension of the 300s default (#2257).

**Why the trigger check, not a file-existence check (#2653).** The old conditional asked whether *any* workflow file exists. Almost every project has one, so it passed nearly always and sent the step on to wait against a filter that could not match — a vacuous pass dressed as a gate. Whether anything triggers on tags is the question that decides whether waiting is meaningful. The `grep` is a deliberate heuristic that errs toward waiting: over-waiting costs a timeout that reports honestly; under-waiting is the defect this step just had.
### Step 4.8: Update Release Notes

```bash
node .claude/scripts/shared/update-release-notes.js
```

## Summary Checklist

**Core (Before tagging):**
- [ ] Commits analyzed
- [ ] Version confirmed
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] PR merged

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: checklist-before-tag -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: checklist-before-tag -->

**Core (After tagging):**
- [ ] Tag pushed
- [ ] CI workflow completed — **check this only on Step 4.7's verdict** (#2653): a passing tag-scoped `wait-for-ci.js` run, or its explicit "no tag-triggered workflows" skip. Before #2653 this box was ticked by convention with nothing having verified it
- [ ] Release notes updated
- [ ] **Rules reach context in a freshly-installed project (#2736).** Install this release into a scratch project via PHM, start a session, and confirm a rule's content is actually loaded — ask for something only a rule states. **Do not accept the startup block as evidence:** it renders from the hook, a different channel, and rendered correctly throughout the period in which no rule reached context in any deployed project. `/context` reporting a Memory-files figure far below the rules on disk is the symptom. Manual — needs a real PHM install and a live session; `node .claude/scripts/framework/repro-rules-junction.js` builds the isolated fixture to bisect a failure

<!-- Pre-close validation, notifications -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: pre-close -->

## Phase 5: Close & Cleanup

**ASK USER:** Confirm deployment verified and ready to close release.

### Step 5.1: Add Deployment Comment

```bash
gh issue comment [TRACKER_NUMBER] --body "Release $VERSION deployed successfully"
```

### Step 5.2: Delete Working Branch

```bash
git push origin --delete $BRANCH
git branch -d $BRANCH
```

### Step 5.3: Verify GitHub Release

Check if the GitHub release already exists (Step 4.8 may have created it):

```bash
gh release view $VERSION
```

- **If release exists:** Report `"GitHub release $VERSION already exists (created by Step 4.8). Skipping creation."`
- **If release does not exist:** Create it:

```bash
gh release create $VERSION \
  --title "Release $VERSION" \
  --notes-file CHANGELOG.md
```

## Summary Checklist (Close)

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: checklist-close -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: checklist-close -->

## Completion

Release $VERSION is complete:
- Code merged to main
- Tag created and pushed
- Deployment verified
- Tracker issue closed
- Working branch deleted
- GitHub Release created
### Step 6: Closing Cleanup
The prune is **part of** this step, and this step is **numbered** — what makes the claim hold. `One task per numbered step` now covers it, so an unpruned list surfaces as an unfinished task like any other step. The same claim as prose alone was overridden by the rules beside it (#2641).

**Prune the task list** (unconditional — every path, including early-exit paths where Phase 1 created tasks and later phases never ran):
1. `TaskList` — enumerate all tasks.
2. For every task owned by this `/prepare-release` invocation, `TaskUpdate status=deleted`.
3. Do **not** delete tasks created outside this invocation (user TODOs).

**End of Prepare Release**
